    <p>If you've provided a mobile number or email address, we'll send confirmation that we've received your application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p>We’ll process your application.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re eligible</h2>
      <p>If you can get New Style JSA, we'll contact you about an appointment to agree what you need to do to look for work. This agreement is called a 'Claimant Commitment'. We'll usually contact you about the appointment within 14 days.</p>

      <p>This appointment will be with a work coach at your local Jobcentre Plus or Jobs and Benefits office. If you need to bring someone with you to help, you can.</p>

      <p>Check what <a href=https://www.gov.uk>proof of identity and other documentation</a> you need to bring with you.</p>

      <p>You must attend your appointment and agree your Claimant Commitment before we can pay you. Once you've agreed your Claimant Commitment and if you're due a payment, we'll aim to pay you within 7 days.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If you’re not eligible</h2>
      <p>If you cannot get New Style JSA, we’ll send you a letter to explain why. We'll send the letter within 14 days.</p>
